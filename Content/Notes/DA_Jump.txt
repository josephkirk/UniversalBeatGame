## Configuration

### Identity
- **Label**: "Jump"
- **Note Tag**: Input.Jump

### Timing
- **Pre Timing**: Quarter (1/4 note) - More lenient for platformer feel
- **Post Timing**: Half (1/2 note) - Very forgiving, encourages flow

### Visual

## Purpose
Jump action for rhythm platformers.
More forgiving timing to balance precision platforming with rhythm gameplay.
Extended post-timing window allows players to recover from slightly late inputs.

## Example Use Case
In a rhythm platformer where players need to time jumps to the beat while
navigating obstacles. The lenient timing makes the game more accessible while
still requiring rhythmic awareness.
