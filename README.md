# UniversalBeat Rhythm Game System Plugin

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.6+  
**Platform**: Cross-platform compatible (Windows primary)

## Overview

UniversalBeat is a genre-agnostic rhythm game system plugin that provides precise beat tracking and timing accuracy evaluation for player inputs. Designers can configure BPM, check input timing via Blueprint, and bind to event dispatchers for rhythm-based feedback systems.

## Features

- âœ… **BPM-based Beat Tracking** - Set tempo, system tracks beats automatically
- âœ… **Timing Accuracy Checks** - Evaluate input timing (0.0-1.0 scale)
- âœ… **Event-Driven Integration** - React to timing checks and beat events
- âœ… **Player Calibration** - Compensate for hardware latency
- âœ… **Beat Broadcasting** - Sync effects to rhythm with subdivisions
- âœ… **Time Dilation Support** - Choose real-time or dilated-time tracking
- âœ… **Frame-Independent** - Sub-millisecond precision regardless of frame rate
- âœ… **Blueprint-Friendly** - All features accessible without C++

## Installation

1. Copy the `UniversalBeat` folder to your project's `Plugins/` directory

```

### Step 2: Check Input Timing

```
Input Action â†’ Get Subsystem â†’ Check Beat Timing By Label ("Jump") â†’ Returns 0.0-1.0
```

### Step 3: React to Timing
Bind to OnBeatCheck event and get the value of input timing value
```
Branch: Value >= 0.9 â†’ "Perfect!"
Branch: Value >= 0.7 â†’ "Great!"
Branch: Value >= 0.5 â†’ "Good!"
Else â†’ "Miss!"
```

## Example Assets

Check `Content/Blueprints/Examples/` for:
- `BP_RhythmGameExample` - Complete rhythm mechanic implementation
- `WBP_TimingFeedback` - UI widget for timing display
- `WBP_CalibrationUI` - Player calibration interface

## Target Performance

- **Timing Check**: <0.1ms per check
- **Beat Broadcasting**: <0.1ms per frame
- **Target Frame Rate**: 60+ FPS (stable operation at 30+ FPS)
- **Memory Footprint**: ~200 bytes (negligible)
